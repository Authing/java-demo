## What is Authing ?

Authing serves as an identity infrastructure, or Identity As A Service (IDaaS) for cloud computing.

Authing focuses on identity and building social infrastructure for identity sharing across all SaaS software and users to help companies build a secure modern IT infrastructure that not only protects their business, but also redefines the user experience.

Authing is the foundation for secure connections between a complex identity ecology and an application ecology in which countless identities access applications and resources in a borderless way.
